http://couchapp.org[Couchapp], for http://maven.apache.org/[Maven]!
If *that* doesn't get you excited, it may be time to reach for the back
button.

Seriously though, it's currently in alpha, and has only really been used, by
me, to manage my own couch apps.  Documentation and More Stuff Generally is
forthcoming. 

Maven generated project sites are available for the latest
http://dthume.github.com/couchdb-maven-plugin/[release] and
http://dthu.me/projects/couchdb-maven-plugin/[snapshot] versions.
